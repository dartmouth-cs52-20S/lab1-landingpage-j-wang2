I loosely based my landing page upon the Simple Analytics webpage (https://simpleanalytics.com/). I found the clean interface of the site particularly striking, although I replaced their typewriter graphic, for example, with a picture and used a different color scheme. I tried to have a couple of key elements near the top that were denoted with varying symbols, include a button that mimicked their "get started" button, and have some content below as well.

Layout stage:

Some things I tried that did work - implementing a ghost button, refactoring the webpage layout when the size of the screen shrunk, hover effects, links, and icons.

Some things I tried that did not work -  implementing the hamburger menu. In hindsight, I didn't really leave myself enough time to complete this lab to satisfaction. I'll certainly be starting the next few labs a bit earlier :)
